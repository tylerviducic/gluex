# What I Wish I Knew When I Started Doing Experimental Nucear Physics

### Introduction

The idea for this document came during a conversation with Sean Dobbs in which I was lamenting that I finally, in year 7 of my PhD, started implementing good software practices into my analysis workflow. While it's better that I learned and used these things later rather than never, I was frustrated that extremely useful and important practices such as, "writing functions", and, "using github" weren't taught to me when I joined the ODU Nuclear Phyiscs research group. Now, It's not Dr. Amaryan or Dr Kuhn's fault - it's not their job to teach us these things; their job is to teach us physics, not software engineering - but it is frustrating nonetheless.

During the aforementioned lamenting, Sean told me:

> maybe if you have time, you should write a short presentation or wiki page of "software things I wish I had known when I started out as a grad student", to help others out

This document is my attempt at that. While thinking about knowledge I wanted to pass on to the newest generation of ~~underpaid code monkeys~~ graduate students, I realized that the scope of that "wisdom" extends beyond good coding practices. 

To whomever reads this, I hope you find it useful. It's not comprehensive, and it's not gospel. It's just a collection of things I wish I knew when I started doing experimental nuclear physics.
